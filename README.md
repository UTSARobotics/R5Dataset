# R5 Dataset

**Dataset for the UTSA R5 Robotics Competition**

## Intro ✅

Hello! This repo contains camera data and associated labels for winning the R5 robotics competition. We have a few tasks we want to perform using neural networks because, well, neural networks are cool! 🧠🤖

Tasks include:

* Box detection 📦- bounding box
* QR Code detection ◼️ - bounding box
* Net detection 🥅 - segmentation
* Painter's tape path detection 🖌️ - segmentation

## Labels

The labels for this dataset can be generated using our [*NeuralLabeler* 🧠](https://github.com/UTSARobotics/NeuralLabeler)!

After generating labels (.pngs or .json files associated with each input image), upload them to git!

* git add <my new label folder>
* git commit -m "added new labels 🚀🔥💥"
* git push
